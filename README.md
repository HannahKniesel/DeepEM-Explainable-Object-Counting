# Deep-EM Playground: Bringing Deep Learning to Electron Microscopy Labs

This codebase is part of the Deep-EM Playground. For more details, please see our [webpage](https://viscom-ulm.github.io/DeepEM/).


## Image to Value(s)


### Primary Focus: Explainable Object Counting in Microscopy Images
### Application: Explainable Virus Capsid Quantification
#### Challenge: Deep Learning as Black Box
#### Required Labels: Location Labels


TL;DR ðŸ§¬âœ¨ We developed a regression model to quantify virus capsids and their mutation stages ("naked" ðŸ©², "budding" ðŸŒ±, "enveloped" ðŸ“¦) during secondary envelopment in TEM images. Researchers can adapt the provided notebook within the primary focus area for their own EM data analysis (i.e. counting midrochondia).
